At the start screen it shows that you can press c for controls while in the game
the start button makes a new game and will overwrite the old save file
the load button will attempt to load the game data from a text file, if it fails it will make a new game
Enter a name: you can put your name in the text widget for the address of the house

the point of the game is to buy many fields and take care of them, harvest then sell them.

once you press start you can use the arrow keys or WASD to move the tractor
i is the main key for interacting with fields but buying and selling is b and v
you start off owning field 19, right above the house.
there is no collision yet so you go straight up then press i and a message will show " waiting for second key" second key is J K L,
each stand for a crop type as stated in controls.
then after a crop is planted it will turn green and you have the option to fertilize the field
fertilizing the field will result in a higher yield. 10% for each stage, (max 20%)
(made an update to fertilizer because a profit was not being made instead of 20% its now 90%)
then it takes 160 seconds to 205 seconds to grow fully, stage 1 taking the longest
the van is used for fast selling of crops and traveling to places
the harvester is used for getting an extar 60% yield for every harvest when using it but it is slower at moving.
you can buy and sell fields without losing money for selling
after harvest then you move towards the selling station to collect profit. 
buying and selling certian things like crops and seeds are a diffrent amount eachtime.
i also saves the game and on form closing
i don't know what happens when the fuel runs out
